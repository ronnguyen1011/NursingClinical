A web information portal built for Green River College's Nursing Program using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and JS. Hosted through WH4S and managed on cPanel. 

This project was worked on over 5 sprints, each lasting two weeks. At the end of each sprint we present our progress to a liason at the GRC Nursing Program, and implemented any feedback and suggestions prior to starting the next sprint. 

We created a new folder for each sprint, so our progress can be tracked from sprint 1 - sprint 5.

# Team Agreement v3
The following represents our Team Agreement, initially drafted prior to Sprint 1, and updated throught the project.

## Roles
The following roles will be evaluated at the start of each sprint, and may be swapped based on the work necessary for that sprint.

### Person of the People:
- Resolves conflicts or disagreements between team members
- Checks in with team members on status of features they are implementing

### Tech Maester:
- The go-to person for technical decisions. Ensures that the team is completing requirements using a technically sound approach.
- Overseas code quality and ensures adherence to the team's coding standards.

### Determiner of Correspondences:
- Schedules and runs *all* team meetings for the current sprint, including meetings held weekly on Tue/Thu.

## Meetings
- Every Tuesday we will meet to plan out the work for that week & work on any minor issues.
- Every Thursday we will meet to collaborate on the current sprint & tackle on any major issues.
- We will meet the Sunday or Monday prior to the sprint deadline to go over all features and rehearse our presenation.
- If a meeting is required outside of those days, the Determiner of Correspondences will organize how (discord/in person) and when they take place.
- A meeting may be called at any time if a team member is no longer comfortable in their current role. This may result in a reassignment of roles or shift of workload.

## Workflows
- We will utilize GitHub Issues to centralize and organize project data (features, requirements, meetings, and agreements)
